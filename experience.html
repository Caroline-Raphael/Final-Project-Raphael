          <h2>SoBe Vegan</h2>
          <p>In my past year with Aventure Capital, I have become incredibly close to our latest venture, SoBe Vegan. SoBe Vegan is a new entirely plant-based fast casual restaurant in Fort Lauderdale. My job is managing the company's social media, as well as the firm's public relations and marketing. In learning the brand, I was trained in Search Engine Optimization, Social Media and Digital Marketing, and Google Analytics. I have written blog posts for the company's website, taken photographs for the social media platforms and marketing purposes, learned the operations side of the business, and much more. It has been a wonderful opportunity, and I see myself staying with the firm in the future.</p>
